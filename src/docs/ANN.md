This class gives a biological and historical overview of artificial neural
networks and walks through the theoretical foundations of backpropagation and
gradient descent, using an example in numpy.

As an additional exercise, this notebook runs the provided backpropagation
code, visualizing neural activations and error at each step.

## Additional Resources

In class we present a Universal Approximation Theorem for single-layer networks
with sigmoid activation functions. The slides for that proof are here:
[Universal Approximation Theorem](UniversalApproximationTheorem.pdf)

[This online book](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap4.html) has a
nice interactive visualization of this property of neural networks.

[The deep learning book](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/) is fully available
online and contains many great examples. Notebook versions of those examples are
available [here](https://github.com/hadrienj/deepLearningBook-Notes)

Stanford CS229 Lectures 11 and 12 introduce ANNs, backpropagation, and gradient
descent, with lecture 12 going further in depth on how to resolve common
training problems in ANNs.
