Satellite imagery more or less prevents the foreground/background effect that sometimes require large changes in scale between training and testing for \"normal\" photography. So you can ignore the bits about the image pyramid on this issue (it is very good for general culture though, and can be applied in other use cases, or if we used multiscale training to \"zoom\" small aircrafts for example)"

    "\n",

    "\n",

Its kernel size is 64x64, there are one or two filters depending on if you coded with softmax or crossentropy. You then just have to decide on the stride of this convolution... And to keep in mind how to go back to coordinates to plot your aircrafts afterwards ;)\n",
