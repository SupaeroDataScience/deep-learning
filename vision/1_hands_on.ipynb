    "Pytorch ignite is what we call a \"high-level library\" over pytorch, its objectives is to abstract away most of the boilerplate code for training deep neural network.\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually, they make the development process easier by enabling you to focus on what's important instead of writing distributed and optimized training loops and plugging metrics / callbacks. Because we all forgot to call `.backward()` or `.zero_grad()` at least once.\n",

    "\n",
    "Of these, we would like to highlight three of them:\n",
    "\n",
    "- pytorch-ignite, officially sanctioned by the pytorch team (its repo lives at https://pytorch.org/ignite/), which is developped by [someone from Toulouse](https://twitter.com/vfdev_5) - yes there is a member of the pytorch team living in Toulouse, we are not THAT behind in ML/DL :wishful-thinking:\n",
    "\n",
    "- pytorch-lightning (https://www.pytorchlightning.ai/) which has recently seen its 1.0 milestone and has bee developped to a company. It is more \"research oriented\" that pytorch-ignite, and with a lower abstraction level, but seems to enable more use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "- skorch (https://github.com/skorch-dev/skorch). This class was previously written in skorch. Skorch mimics the scikit-learn API and allows bridging the two libraries together. It's a bit less powerful but you write much less code than the two libraries above, and if you are very familiar with scikit-learn, it could be very useful for fast prototyping\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Take a look at the [previous class](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/SupaeroDataScience/deep-learning/blob/main/deep/PyTorch%20Ignite.ipynb), the [official examples](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/pytorch/ignite/tree/master/examples/notebooks/) or the [documentation](https://pytorch.org/ignite/) if you need help using ignite**"
