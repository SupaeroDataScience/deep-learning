For instance, an image from a standard digital camera will have a red, green and blue channel. A grayscale image has just one channel.\n",

    "The function below implements a basic 2D convolution from scratch. Here's what it does:\n",

    "**Key Steps:**\n",
    "1. **Initialize** an output array with reduced dimensions (we lose `k//2` pixels on each side)\n",
    "2. **Slide** the kernel across the image pixel by pixel\n",
    "3. **Element-wise multiply** the kernel with the corresponding image patch\n",
    "4. **Sum** all the multiplied values to get a single output pixel\n",
    "5. **Clip** values to valid pixel range [0, 255]\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important Notes:**\n",
    "- The kernel size `k` is usually odd (e.g., 3×3, 5×5) so it has a clear center pixel\n",
    "- Without padding, the output is smaller than the input by `2*p` pixels (where `p = k//2`)\n",
    "- This is a \"valid\" convolution - we only compute where the kernel fully overlaps the image\n",
    "- The nested loops make this slow (real implementations use optimized C/CUDA code)\n",

    "The `train()` function implements one epoch of training. Here's the standard deep learning training cycle:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Training Loop Components:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`model.train()`**: Sets model to training mode\n",
    "   - Enables dropout (if present), batch normalization updates, etc.\n",
    "   - Important: Different behavior than `model.eval()`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Batch Processing Loop**: Iterate over mini-batches from DataLoader\n",
    "   - `enumerate(train_loader)` gives us batches of (data, target)\n",
    "   - Batch size = 64 images at a time (memory efficient)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Move to Device**: `data.to(device)`, `target.to(device)`\n",
    "   - Transfers tensors to GPU/MPS/CPU as configured\n",
    "   - Critical for GPU acceleration!\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **The Optimization Cycle** (repeated for each batch):\n",
    "\n",
    "   a. **`optimizer.zero_grad()`**: Clear previous gradients\n",
    "      - PyTorch accumulates gradients by default - must reset!\n",
    "      - Forgetting this causes incorrect updates\n",
    "\n",
    "   b. **Forward Pass**: `output = model(data)`\n",
    "      - Run input through network\n",
    "      - Compute predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "   c. **Loss Computation**: `loss = F.nll_loss(output, target)`\n",
    "      - Negative log-likelihood loss for classification\n",
    "      - Measures how wrong the predictions are\n",
    "\n",
    "   d. **`loss.backward()`**: Compute gradients via backpropagation\n",
    "      - Automatic differentiation! PyTorch's magic\n",
    "      - Computes ∂loss/∂weight for every parameter\n",
    "\n",
    "   e. **`optimizer.step()`**: Update weights using gradients\n",
    "      - SGD update: weight = weight - learning_rate × gradient\n",
    "      - With momentum: smooths updates over time\n",
    "\n",
    "**The `perm` Parameter**: Used for pixel permutation experiment (explained later)\n",
    "- Default: `torch.arange(0, 784)` keeps pixels in order\n",
    "- Experiment: Random permutation to test CNN assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Practical Tips:**\n",
    "- Always check loss is decreasing during training\n",
    "- Print progress every N batches to monitor training\n",
    "- If loss is NaN: learning rate too high or numerical instability"

    "\n",
    "The `test()` function evaluates model performance on unseen data without updating weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Differences from Training:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`model.eval()`**: Sets model to evaluation mode\n",
    "   - Disables dropout (use all neurons)\n",
    "   - Uses running statistics for batch normalization\n",
    "   - No gradient computation needed (saves memory!)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **No Gradient Updates**: We only need predictions, not backpropagation\n",
    "   - No `optimizer.zero_grad()`, `loss.backward()`, or `optimizer.step()`\n",
    "   - This makes evaluation much faster\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Accumulate Metrics**:\n",
    "   - `test_loss`: Sum of all batch losses (then averaged)\n",
    "   - `correct`: Count of correctly classified samples\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Loss Aggregation**: `reduction=\"sum\"`\n",
    "   - Sums loss over all samples (not average per batch)\n",
    "   - Then divide by total samples for mean loss\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Prediction Extraction**: `output.data.max(1, keepdim=True)[1]`\n",
    "   - `max(1, ...)`: Find max value along dimension 1 (class dimension)\n",
    "   - `[1]`: Get indices (class labels), not values\n",
    "   - Returns predicted class for each sample\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Accuracy Calculation**:\n",
    "   - Compare predictions with ground truth: `pred.eq(target)`\n",
    "   - Sum correct predictions and divide by total samples\n",
    "\n",
    "**Best Practice:** Always evaluate on a held-out test set to detect overfitting!\n",
    "- Training accuracy might be high but test accuracy low → overfitting\n",
    "- Both low → underfitting (need more capacity or training)\n",
    "- Both high → good generalization!"

    "**Expected Results:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **CNN on Normal Data (Highest)**: ~85-90% accuracy\n",
    "   - Assumptions match reality → maximum benefit from inductive bias\n",
    "   - Learns efficiently with few parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **FC on Normal Data (Good)**: ~75-80% accuracy\n",
    "   - No built-in assumptions, must learn spatial structure from scratch\n",
    "   - Requires more data/parameters to match CNN performance\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **FC on Scrambled Data (Same as #2)**: ~75-80% accuracy\n",
    "   - **Key insight**: Performance unchanged!\n",
    "   - No spatial assumptions to violate\n",
    "   - Treats pixels as independent features regardless of order\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **CNN on Scrambled Data (Worst)**: ~60-70% accuracy\n",
    "   - **Critical drop**: Inductive bias now hurts!\n",
    "   - Convolutions assume nearby pixels are related (they're not anymore)\n",

    "|--------------|-------------|-----------|----------|\n",
    "| **CNN** | Strong spatial priors | Structured grid data (images, audio spectrograms) | Unstructured data, tabular data |\n",
    "| **FC** | No assumptions | Any data type, especially when structure is unknown | Images/sequences (needs more data) |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Practical Takeaways:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Use CNNs for images** - the inductive bias is almost always helpful\n",
    "2. **Don't use CNNs for tabular data** - no spatial structure to exploit\n",
    "3. **Architecture choice encodes assumptions** - choose based on data structure\n",
    "4. **More assumptions ≠ always better** - assumptions must match reality\n",
    "5. **Data efficiency**: Right assumptions dramatically reduce data needs\n",
    "\n",
    "**Modern Extensions:**\n",
    "- **Vision Transformers (ViT)**: Less inductive bias than CNNs, needs more data but more flexible\n",
    "- **Graph Neural Networks**: Inductive bias for graph-structured data\n",
    "- **Transformers**: Minimal assumptions, sequence order learned from position embeddings\n",
